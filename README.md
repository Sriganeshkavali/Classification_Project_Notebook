## Project 1: Ad Click Prediction Model
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning classification models to predict user ad engagement (click or no-click) based on demographic and behavioral data.

### Goal
The primary objective is to identify the most effective model and key features that drive ad clicks, providing actionable insights for digital marketing optimization.

Methodology Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Handled significant missing data through median (for age) and mode (for categorical features) imputation.

Feature Engineering: Applied One-Hot Encoding to categorical variables and standardized the numerical age feature.

Modeling: Trained and evaluated three classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest).

Evaluation: Used standard classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score) to compare model performance and select the best predictor.
